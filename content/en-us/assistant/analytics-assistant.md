## Analytics reports

<Alert severity="warning">
  To get Assistant reports, your experience must have 1000+ DAU. Monthly reports are available in the first week of every month, and weekly reports are available at the start of each of the remaining weeks.
</Alert>

To access the insights report generated by Assistant:

1. Go to Creations and select an experience.
2. In the experience's **Overview** page, click **See full report**.

The report focuses on the following key metrics:

- **Top drivers for revenue and DAU changes**: Identify what's driving your revenue and DAU changes, whether it's a specific monetization product or acquisition channel. Learn what's working for your experience, and where you can get the most value out of what you build.
- **Automatic outlier detection**: Automatically identify outlier segments instead of manually filtering by age, country, and platform. For example, if retention is your lowest benchmark and has declined over the past week, Assistant can tell you that retention has dropped significantly more on iOS or among 18+ users.
- **Player feedback summaries**: Understand top requests and takeaways from your actual users over the past week or month, and prioritize what to work on next.

You can also review personalized charts and recommendations in the report that Assistant has generated.
